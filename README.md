# ING Autofill

> Make password managers autofill work on the ING bank's website.

## Why?

As a 1Password user, I hated the fact that my bank uses a masked password strategy â€” it renders the autofill functionality useless and forces me to use the "Show in Large Type" functionality.

When I first realized that my password manager does not support autofilling masked passwords, I stumbled upon some threads on the 1Password forum. I did not, however, search for any existing solutions to this problem at that time, nor before starting coding this utility a few years later.

Out of pure Sunday boredom, I gave myself an hour to create the simplest Chrome extension that would fix this annoying issue.

After making something that works as expected, I searched for some alternatives and found:
- https://github.com/piotr-sarna/ING-Password-Filler
- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ing-%20-1password-autofill/heagjbohbnbaioaiekgioabidmgoihdc?hl=pl

I did not bother trying them, but a first glance instantly revealed some issues:
- the former project seems overly complex; using Svelte to inject another form into the login page ðŸ¤”
- the latter is not open-source and only available via the Chrome Web Store; this is a no-go for security-focused utilities in my opinion, especially when it comes to online banking

Therefore, I felt happy with what I came up with.

In May 2024, I updated the extension so that it now works on ING's new website.

## Highlights
- Simple (a single file, <100 LOC, easy to understand)
- Uses Manifest V3, with a minimal number of permissions

## How does it work?

1. We create hidden inputs for both the username and the password, making sure password managers will see them and autofill accordingly.
2. Once the hidden login input gets autofilled, we fill the actual login input click on the "Next" button.
3. Once the hidden password input gets autofilled, we fill the actual masked password inputs accordingly and click on the final "Login" button.

## Supported password managers
- 1Password
- Bitwarden

> [!NOTE]  
> Other password managers may work as well; this list only includes those which were tested and confirmed to be working.
